This app generates a collatz sequence based on a given input n. 
The Collatz Conjecture (1937): Start with any positive integer n, divide by two if n is even, or multiply by three and add one if n is odd, repeat. 
The conjecture states that this sequence will eventually reach 1. Almost a century later, the conjecture is still unsolved: no mathematical proof and no counter-example! 
Studying it nevertheless has lead into several directions intersectsing number theory, combinatorics, mathematical analysis, probability and statistics, fractal geometry, and computational complexity. 
Paul Erdos famously said "Mathematics may not be ready for such problems". 
Below is a simple python script to calcualte and visualize the Collatz sequence. Do you see a common pattern there?!
